# Socket Programming Projects

A collection of socket-based applications showcasing the fundamentals of network communication. This repository contains the following two projects:

1. **Webserver**: A lightweight web server built in C to serve static web pages.
2. **Chat Application**: A real-time chat application implemented in C using sockets for client-server communication.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the application has multithreading implemented for multi user access and handle multiple connections.

## Webserver

### Features
- Serves static HTML files to clients over HTTP.
- Handles basic HTTP `GET` and `POST` requests.
- Multithreaded to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
- Simple to configure and run.

### Usage
1. Compile the webserver:
   ```bash
   gcc webserver.c -o webserver
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   ./webserver
   ```
3. Access the server via a browser or a tool like `postman`:
   ```
   http://localhost:<port>
   ```
> [!TIP]
> Use `-lpthread` if you get hit with a warning that `pthread is undefined`

## Chat Application

### Features
- Real-time, text-based messaging between multiple clients.
- Server handles concurrent clients using threads.
- Lightweight and efficient implementation using low level C sockets.

### Demo

### Usage
1. Compile both server and client:
   ```bash
   gcc server.c -o server
   ```
   ```bash
   gcc client.c -o client
   ```

2. Start up the server by just:
   ```bash
   ./server
   ```
3. Start the client with whatever `PORT` that isn't busy:
    ```bash
    ./client <port-numeber>
    ```
4. Create multiple clients in different windows to access multiple chat clients.
